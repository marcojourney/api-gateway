HTTP is also a reliable protocol, but it is not as reliable as TCP. HTTP does not guarantee that all data will be delivered, 
or that it will be delivered in the same order in which it was sent. However, HTTP is a more lightweight protocol than TCP, 
and it can be used to transmit smaller amounts of data.

Here is a table comparing the two protocols:

| Feature          | TCP          | HTTP           |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Reliability      | Guaranteed   | Not guaranteed |
| Ordered delivery | Guaranteed   | Not guaranteed |
| Flow control     | Yes          | No             |
| Error detection  | Yes          | No             |
| Latency          | Higher       | Lower          |
| Bandwidth        | Higher       | Lower          |
| Ease of use      | More complex | Less complex   |
| Widely supported | Yes          | Yes            |

In general, TCP is a better choice for applications that require a high degree of reliability, such as financial transactions or email. 
HTTP is a better choice for applications that do not require as much reliability, such as web browsing or file transfers.

Here are some examples of when TCP would be a better choice than HTTP:

* **Sending financial data:** Financial data is sensitive and critical, so it is important to ensure that it is delivered reliably. 
TCP can guarantee that all data will be delivered, even if some packets are lost or corrupted.
* **Sending email:** Email is also sensitive data, and it is important to ensure that it is delivered reliably. 
TCP can guarantee that all email will be delivered, even if some packets are lost or corrupted.
* **Streaming video:** Streaming video requires a lot of bandwidth, and TCP can provide a more reliable way to transmit large amounts of data.

Here are some examples of when HTTP would be a better choice than TCP:

* **Web browsing:** Web browsing does not require a high degree of reliability, so HTTP is a good choice. 
HTTP is also a more lightweight protocol than TCP, so it can be used to improve the performance of web browsing.
* **File transfers:** File transfers do not require a high degree of reliability, so HTTP is a good choice. 
HTTP is also a more lightweight protocol than TCP, so it can be used to improve the performance of file transfers.
* **Real-time applications:** Real-time applications require low latency, so UDP is a better choice than TCP. 
UDP is a more lightweight protocol than TCP, so it can be used to improve the performance of real-time applications.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use TCP or HTTP depends on the specific requirements of the application.
