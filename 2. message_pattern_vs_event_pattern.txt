Sure. Message pattern and event pattern are two different ways of communication between microservices.

**Message pattern** is a one-to-one communication pattern, where a message is sent from one microservice to another microservice. 
The message is typically sent in response to an event, such as a user action or a change in state.

**Event pattern** is a one-to-many communication pattern, where an event is published by a microservice and can be subscribed to by other microservices. 
The event is typically published in response to a change in state.

Here is a table comparing the two patterns:

| Feature                    | Message pattern    | Event pattern           |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Communication type         | One-to-one         | One-to-many             |
| Direction of communication | Sender to receiver | Publisher to subscriber |
| Trigger                    | Event              | Event                   |
| Delivery guarantee         | Guaranteed         | Not guaranteed          |
| Ordering                   | Guaranteed         | Not guaranteed          |
| Latency                    | Lower              | Higher                  |
| Bandwidth                  | Lower              | Higher                  |
| Ease of use                | Easier             | More complex            |
| Scalability                | Good               | Excellent               |

In general, message pattern is a better choice for applications that require a guaranteed delivery and ordering of messages. 
Event pattern is a better choice for applications that need to scale easily and do not require a guaranteed delivery or ordering of events.

Here are some examples of when message pattern would be a better choice than event pattern:

* **Sending a notification to a user:** When a user takes an action, such as clicking on a link, 
a message can be sent to the user's microservice to notify them of the action.
* **Updating a database:** When a change is made to a database, a message can be sent to the microservice that is responsible for updating the database.
* **Sending an email:** When an email needs to be sent, a message can be sent to the microservice that is responsible for sending emails.

Here are some examples of when event pattern would be a better choice than message pattern:

* **Tracking changes in state:** When a microservice changes state, an event can be published so that other microservices can be notified of the change.
* **Triggering a workflow:** When an event is published, a workflow can be triggered to handle the event.
* **Scaling a system:** When a system needs to be scaled, events can be used to decouple microservices and make it easier to scale the system.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use message pattern or event pattern depends on the specific requirements of the application.
